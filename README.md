# Unico Campania App - A first approach to app redesign

**Fast redesign of the app, focusing on the main call to actions related to tickets: check/validate your active tickets and buy a new one.**

This project was mainly aimed at practicing more with the iOS Human Interface Guidelines and native components. 

_Personal goal as a non-designer:_ make it clean!

_Personal goals as a coder:_
to explore the use of native components such as
- List and tables
- Modals (presenting sheet)
- Horizontal scroll view 
- Tab bar

and develop other functionalities like
- QR code generator (from a combination of a random alphanumeric string and the user mail)
- Use of timer
