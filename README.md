<h1> Unico Campania App - A first approach to app redesign </h1>

Redesign of the UnicoCampania app, where I've decided to design a clean and easy-to-use solution to give you access to your tickets in just one tap.

<h2> Project goal </h2>

This solo-project was practical exercise to dive deeper into the Apple's [Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/guidelines/overview/) and native components at the Apple Developer Academy, learner program 22/23.

<h2> Technologies </h2>

The whole app was developed in Xcode, using Swift as a programming language and SwiftUI framework. <br>Prototypes and UI elements where entirely designed in Figma

<h2> Process </h2>

+ Prototyping: from hand-drawn sketches to Figma hi-fi prototype.
+ Front-end implementation of the Tickets tab, containing the main ticket-related call to actions: validate your tickets and buy new ones following three different paths, depending on the user needs.
+ Back-end implementation of a full-screen modal to display tickets details and QR code which will be generated both automatically (through the use of a timer) and manually by pressing a button.
+ Explored iOS HIG for a clean and user-friendly design and color accessibility, the use of native components such as lists, a horizontal scroll view, modals and a tab bar.
