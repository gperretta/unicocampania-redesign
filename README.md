# Unico Campania App - A first approach to app redesign

**Fast redesign of the app, focusing on the main call to actions that are related to tickets: check/validate your active tickets and buy a new one.**

This project was mainly aimed at practicing more with the [iOS Human Interface Guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/guidelines/overview/) and exploring the use of some native components such as:
- List and tables;
- Modals (presenting sheet);
- Horizontal scroll view;
- Tab bar.

**Plus**: I've also implemented a QR code generator to produce multiple QR codes from the combination of a randomly generated alphanumeric string and the user mail - to simulate its uniqueness; a timer will allow the qr code to be refreshed automatically when expired.
